# UPCo Customizations
Below are customizations done by us

## Nested project directory
Everything is nested in the {PLUGIN_DIR}/blocks/{BLOCK_PROJECT_NAME} and is actually included with the PHP file in the main plugin directory.
Please add additional projects there.

## additional NPM packages
We added more dev dependencies to facilitate development.

```
npm install --save-dev babel-core babel-eslint babel-loader css-loader eslint @wordpress/babel-preset-default extract-text-webpack-plugin webpack webpack-cli
```

## Webpack
We are using Webpack instead of the default npm start and stop scripts that came with Guten Blocks.
We modified the package.json to build with webpack:

```
--- removed ---
  "scripts": {
    "start": "cgb-scripts start",
    "build": "cgb-scripts build",
    "eject": "cgb-scripts eject"
  },
--- added ---
  "scripts": {
    "start": "cross-env BABEL_ENV=default MODE=development webpack --watch",
    "build": "cross-env BABEL_ENV=default MODE=production webpack"
  },

```

We also added a .babelrc file.

# Default Guten Blocks Instructions

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Guten Block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block).

Below you will find some information on how to run scripts.

>You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block).

## ðŸ‘‰  `npm start`
- Use to compile and run the block in development mode.
- Watches for any changes and reports back any errors in your code.

## ðŸ‘‰  `npm run build`
- Use to build production code for your block inside `dist` folder.
- Runs once and reports back the gzip file sizes of the produced code.

## ðŸ‘‰  `npm run eject`
- Use to eject your plugin out of `create-guten-block`.
- Provides all the configurations so you can customize the project as you want.
- It's a one-way street, `eject` and you have to maintain everything yourself.
- You don't normally have to `eject` a project because by ejecting you lose the connection with `create-guten-block` and from there onwards you have to update and maintain all the dependencies on your own.
