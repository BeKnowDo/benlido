and we all share a common experience: the night before we travel, we find ourselves scrambling to find the supplies we need,
and wasting time taking trips to stores only to find we can’t get what we want. Learning from countless times of inconvenience,
we wanted to dig deeper into what travelers want and need. So, we launched the first subscription-based kit for you, and
everyone like us. Our kits keep your ready: Your favorite brands, in the sizes you need, at the best prices, backed by 20
years of know-how, delivered straight to your door (or wherever you adventures take you). Welcome to Ben Lido. Wander well.',

of adventure. To seduce your instinct for exploration. To be that constant whisper in your ear saying: “let’s do this”...
and when ready you’re go, to make sure you’re prepared.', author: '— Drew Rayman, CEO', backgroundImage: '/images/BL__about_hero02_1920.jpg'
