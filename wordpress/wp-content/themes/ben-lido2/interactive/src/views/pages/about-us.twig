share a common experience: the night before we travel, we find ourselves scrambling to find the supplies we need. We
waste time taking trips to stores, only to find limited choices and empty shelves. We learned from inconvenience, and
launched the first subscription-based travel kit for wanderers just like us. Our kits keep you forever-ready: All your
favorite brands, in the sizes you need, at the best prices, backed by 20 years of know-how, delivered straight to your
door (or wherever your adventures take you). Welcome to Ben Lido. Wander Well.',
