# Basel Child for Ben Lido
This is some info about this particular theme.

## Migration
For some reason, the configuration doesn't seem to carry. Need to export from the dev site and import into the theme.
Also, some plugins don't think to install by themselves. Need to figure that out.

## Where I left off
I'm tracking my TODOs here
1. Swapping - got as far as getting the button there and the start swap process
2. Swapping - need to style the swap button
3. Swapping - need to write a jQuery document ready script to detect which item in the cart is in the swapping process (this is because the mini-cart is cached as a snippet in browser storage)
4. Swapping - need to write the code to make the exchange
5. Remote from Cart - not working correctly all the time.. need to see what's going on.
